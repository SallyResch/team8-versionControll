        <h2>ðŸ§­ Project Overview</h2>
        <p class="explanation">
          Learn Version Control was created as part of a practical assignment to
          explore the importance of version control systems in modern software
          development.The goal of this project is to help learners understand
          why version control matters and how tools like Git and GitHub enable
          collaboration, code safety, and professional workflow management.<br/>
          Version control is the backbone of teamwork in programming. It allows
          developers to track progress, experiment safely, and contribute to
          shared projects without losing work. By completing this project,
          you,ll gain hands-on experience with Git commands and the GitHub
          platform, preparing you for real-world development environments.
        </p>
        <h2>ðŸ’¡ Introduction</h2>
        <p class="explanation">
          This website serves as an introduction to these tools, helping you
